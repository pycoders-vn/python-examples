Speeding up CPU-bound and IO-bound operations with multiprocessing, threading, and AsyncIO

> Blog post: [Parallelism, Concurrency, and AsyncIO in Python - by example](http://testdriven.io/blog/python-concurrency-parallelism/)

## Setup

1. Fork/Clone
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
1. Install the dependencies

## IO-bound Operation

```sh
$ python io-bound_sync.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_1.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_2.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_3.py
```

## CPU-bound Operation

```sh
$ python cpu-bound_sync.py
$ python cpu-bound_parallel_1.py
$ python cpu-bound_parallel_2.py
```
